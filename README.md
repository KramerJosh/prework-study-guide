# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created for 3 main purposes:
1 - to track what I've learned so far about web dev.
2 - to create a tool to pick which topics to study.
3 - to put into practice the skills I'd been learning.

With this Study Guide website I now have a place to store notes and study, as well as to continue practicing.

The biggest lessons learned in making this all fall under the Git/Version Control umbrella.  The workflow was different from anything else I've worked on, but makes a lot of sense now.  I also was able to practice the basics of HTML, linking an external CSS sheet, and iterating over an array with a for loop.

## Usage

The prework study guide has two different uses.  The first is that it stores notes and information about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git that students can refer back to.

The second use appears when we open the DevTools, either by right-click --> inspecting the page, or by pressing F12.  In the console we can see the result of the javascript in the project which randomly selects a topic for stud.
